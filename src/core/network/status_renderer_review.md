### StatusRenderer â€” Review against Network Monitoring Pipeline v2

Date: 2025-08-25
Target file: `src/core/network/status_renderer.rs`

---

#### Classification Overview
- Critical: 0 findings
- Medium: 0 findings
- Low: 3 findings

---

### Medium
- None. The renderer now aligns with the stated preferences:
  - No `error_type` in output (terminal shows it elsewhere).
  - Degraded and Error include breakdown, with optional line wrapping.
  - Unknown renders exactly as requested.

### Low
- Newline wrapping vs statusline visibility
  - The UI only shows the first line of stdout; wrapped breakdown on the next line wonâ€™t appear in the status line UI. Accepted by preference; consider ellipsis/truncation if single-line display is desired later.

- Width calculation uses byte length
  - `.len()` counts bytes, not display width; emoji/wide glyphs may skew the 80-char heuristic. Optional: switch to a grapheme/ANSI-aware width or fixed ellipsis.

- Optional debug sidecar log for render summary
  - Caller currently responsible. Optionally add a `DebugLogger` hook to log final emoji/status summary for consistency.

---

### Meets Requirements
- Emoji mapping: ðŸŸ¢/ðŸŸ¡/ðŸ”´/âšª align with healthy/degraded/error/unknown.
- Healthy: P95 only; Degraded: P95 + breakdown; Error: breakdown only; Unknown: "âšª Env varis NOT Found" â€” matches preference.
- No `error_type` included by design, per preference.
- Pure renderer: no state writes, no I/O.

---

### Recommendations (Ordered)
1. If single-line status is desired later, switch wrapping to truncation/ellipsis.
2. Consider display-width-aware length checks to improve wrapping decisions.
3. Optionally emit a render-summary entry via `DebugLogger` when enabled.
